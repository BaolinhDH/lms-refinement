Icons all come from fontawesome.com.

Includes dummy content for four hypothetical university courses.

Note to the Javascript team: All selectors for HTML DOM objects you should need are stored as id attributes on elements. Feel free to add id's to elements as needed.

All elements/links that aren't supposed to be functional are given the class name 'dummy'. Be sure to style it to be apparent that it doesn't work, okay?
All elements that are student-exclusive are given class name 'student'
All elements that are lecturer-exclusive are given class name 'lecturer'

Some style classes and tags have been added to CSS files. Feel free to add more to help you style.
